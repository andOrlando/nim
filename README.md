# Nim
TUI (Terminal User Interface) for playing Nim but it's cool becuase it's in the browser and there's a basically unbeatable algorithm too

### Controls:
 - `Q`/`ESC`: go back to preview menu
 - `SPACE`/`ENTER`: select
 - `WASD`/`Arrow Keys`:  navigation
 - Click on `End Turn` to end turns

### Further Reading:
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)

### TODO:
- [ ] Make `End Turn` selectable
- [ ] Make sticks (lines? nimmy things?) clickable and hoverable
- [ ] Add settings with custom heap sizes
- [ ] Change Player 2 Color (settings?)
- [ ] Change Player Names (settings?)
- [ ] Full themeing support (this seems a bit overkill but whatever)
